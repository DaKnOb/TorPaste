# This is an example backend which can serve as a template for you to add
# more backends to TorPaste. Simply edit the content of the functions and
# follow the contracts and guidelines in the comments. Please  note  that
# this file is being imported by the Flask application, which is run with
# Gunicorn with 8 workers.

# Error Handling:
# In order to handle any errors and to keep TorPaste sane, we  are  using
# generic exceptions and we leave the control flow up to the backend dev-
# eloper. That means that when writting this file, you must make some, if
# not all the decisions on what the TorPaste  user  will  experience. So,
# if you face an error that can be overcomed by  any  means,  you  should
# raise the ErrorException and pass some text that will be visible to the
# user. If this exception is raised, it means that the desired action has
# failed and the user should be returned back to the original screen.  If
# the WarningException is raised, it means that the  action is partly co-
# mplete, the user should move to the intended view / screen, but also be
# warned about something you want. This can be used for example in a case
# where part of the action is complete but it did not finish as intended.
# The InfoException can be raised when everything went fine, however  you
# want to show the user an informational message. Please  note  that  the
# backends must have no application logic: you can  assume  that  since a
# certain method was called, say for example to create a new  paste,  the
# web application already checked (or doesn't care) if a paste with  this
# ID already exists. In addition to that, no data sanitization is needed.
# Please make sure that all error messages shown to the user are friendly
# and there's no leakage of private information (don't throw an exception
# whose message is the MySQL error for example).

# Backwards Compatibility
# In order for TorPaste to work without any problem, all backends must be
# backwards compatible with their previous versions. This  of  course  is
# not easy to achieve. You may decide that you need a  schema  change  in
# your database that breaks existing changes. In order to  overcome  this
# problem, you can use the below provided  initialize_backend()  that  can
# migrate the entire database to the new version before the  app  starts.
# However,  this  is  impractical with large databases and can also cause
# problems with parallel executions of this app (either in a  cluster  or
# from multiple workers). This problem can be solved by having your code,
# say for example update to the new format, every time a paste  is  read.
# That means that all pastes will start to update to the new format  over
# time, as they are being viewed by people. For this reason, as  well  as
# the possibility of users upgrading from very very old versions to newer
# ones, your code must be able to support any and all  past  versions  of
# your backend. If your backend is merged upstream, and therefore  relea-
# sed, even if it's for one single minor version, you must keep  support-
# ing that indefinitely. So in order to avoid complicated backends in the
# future,  please  think  very carefully before designing your persistent
# storage, be it database tables, folders and files, or anything else.

# initialize_backend()
# This method is called when the Flask application starts. Here you can do
# any initialization that may be required, such as connecting to a remote
# database or making sure a file exists.

# new_paste(paste_id, paste_content)
# This method is called when the Flask application wants to create a new
# paste. The arguments given are the Paste ID, which is a paste identifier
# that is not neccesarily unique, as well as the paste content. Please note
# that the paste must be retrievable given the above Paste ID as well as
# the fact that paste_id is (typically) an ASCII string while paste_content
# can (and will) contain UTF-8 characters.

def new_paste(paste_id, paste_content):

# update_paste_metadata(paste_id, metadata)
# This method is called by the Flask application to update a paste's
# metadata. For this to happen, the application passes the Paste ID,
# which is typically an ASCII string, as well as a Python dictionary
# that contains the new metadata. This method must overwrite any and
# all metadata with the passed dictionary. For example, if a paste has
# the keys a and b and this method is called with only keys b and c,
# the final metadata must be b and c only, and not a.

def update_paste_metadata(paste_id, metadata):

# does_paste_exist(paste_id)
# This method is called when the Flask application wants to check if a
# paste with a given Paste ID exists. The Paste ID is (typically) an
# ASCII string and your method must return True if a paste with this ID
# exists, or False if it doesn't.

def does_paste_exist(paste_id):
    return False


# get_paste_contents(paste_id)
# This method must return all the paste contents in UTF-8 encoding for
# a given Paste ID. The Paste ID is typically in ASCII, and it is
# guaranteed that this Paste ID exists.

def get_paste_contents(paste_id):
    return "Hello"


# get_paste_metadata(paste_id)
# This method must return a Python Dictionary with all the currently
# stored metadata for the paste with the given Paste ID. All keys of
# the dictionary are typically in ASCII, while all values are in
# UTF-8. It is guaranteed that the Paste ID exists.

def get_paste_metadata(paste_id):
    return {"Key": "Value"}


# get_paste_metadata_value(paste_id, key):
# This method must return the value of the metadata key provided for
# the paste whose Paste ID is provided. If the key is not set, the
# method should return None. You can assume that a paste with this
# Paste ID exists, and you can also assume that both parameters
# passed are typically ASCII.

# get_all_paste_ids()
# This method must return a Python list containing each and every
# Paste ID, in ASCII. The order does not matter so it can be the same
# or it can be different every time this function is called. In the
# case of no pastes, the method must return a Python list with a
# single item, whose content must be equal to 'none'.
